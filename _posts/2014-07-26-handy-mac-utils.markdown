I've applied some tools to what I use on my desktop setup for work. 

* [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) - The missing package manager for OS X. Great for those old favourites that you want with the moimimum of fuss. Been using this for the bones of about 4 years now. 
* [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io/) - “To install, drag this icon…” no more! Useful for installing GUI-based tools.
* [Spectacle](http://spectacleapp.com/) - Move and resize windows with ease. Window control with simple, customizable keyboard shortcuts.
