I've applied some tools to what I use on my desktop setup for work. 

* [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) - The missing package manager for OS X. Great for those old favourites that you want with the moimimum of fuss. Been using this for the bones of about 4 years now. 
* [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io/) - “To install, drag this icon…” no more! Useful for installing GUI-based tools like the few below.
* [Spectacle](http://spectacleapp.com/) - Move and resize windows with ease. Window control with simple, customizable keyboard shortcuts.
* [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/) - iTerm2 is a replacement for Terminal. Version 2 does handy terminal splitting and has tmux integration. 
* [Bearded Spice](http://beardedspice.com/) - control browser-based media players with Mac media keys
* [itermocil](https://github.com/TomAnthony/itermocil) - Create pre-defined window/pane layouts and run commands in iTerm
