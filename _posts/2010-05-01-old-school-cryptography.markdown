Auguste Kerckhoffs ([apart from having a very long name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Kerckhoffs) ) is credited with writing about the concept of secure systems in an attempt to improve the practice of encoded message passing in the French Military. Even today, his essay "[LA CRYPTOGRAPHIE MILITAIRE](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.petitcolas.net%2Ffabien%2Fkerckhoffs%2Fla_cryptographie_militaire_i.htm&sl=auto&tl=en)" makes for a fun read (even through the fog of Google Translate). It includes some handy principles anyone looking at crypto-systems should consider:

 1. The system must be substantially, if not mathematically, undecipherable;
 2. The system must not require secrecy and can be stolen by the enemy without causing trouble;
 3.It must be easy to communicate and remember the keys without requiring written notes, it must also be easy to change or modify the keys with different participants;
 4. The system ought to be compatible with telegraph communication;
 5. The system must be portable, and its use must not require more than one person;
 6. Finally, regarding the circumstances in which such system is applied, it must be easy to use and must neither require stress of mind nor the knowledge of a long series of rules.

He also cites a cipher system from [Francis Beaufort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Beaufort) at the end of the paper, another very interesting character from history.
