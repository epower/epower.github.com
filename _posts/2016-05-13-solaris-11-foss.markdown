This is a further reminder about Solaris 11.3 and Free and Open Source Software.

While setting up some new servers, I noticed that most of the [reference docs point to all the FOSS available for Solaris 11.3 through IPS](https://blogs.oracle.com/solarisfoss/entry/how_to_find_if_a). Some [further investigation](http://pkg.oracle.com/solaris/release/en/search.shtml?token=bind&action=Search) reveals that some of this is [woefully out of date](https://www.isc.org/downloads/) however. 

To avoid building almost all my software from source, its best to have a look at the communities out there:

- [OpenCSW](https://www.opencsw.org/get-it/packages/): a volunteer effort to provide more up to date packages for Solaris 10 and Solaris 11
- [NetBSD packages](http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/current/pkgsrc/README-all.html) - used by SmartOS
