I noticed that [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) arrived the other day so this was a good excuse to try out an upgrade. At the same time, I'd also been using [Twitter Bower](http://bower.io/) for the last couple of months. Given that I'm using Bootstrap, Font Awesome and jQuery, I built a Bower file to let me manage the whole lot.
