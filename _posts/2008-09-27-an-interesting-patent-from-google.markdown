While [Damien](http://www.mulley.net/2008/09/27/fluffy-links-saturday-27th-september-2008/) got to it first, I spotted [this patent](http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=%2220080232574%22.PGNR.&OS=DN/20080232574&RS=DN/20080232574) in [Techcrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/25/googles-end-run-around-the-wireless-carriers/). I hope they consider contributing it to the [Open Innovation Network](http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/) because an idea like this could be really useful in the long term. Also worth noting that Google apparently joined OIN in August 2007. Either way, work has started in this area already on this side of the world in the form of [Perimeter](http://www.ict-perimeter.eu/).
